# Python package for RFM and Customer segmentation. 

To develop customer loyalty and selecting profitable clients it is important to identify customer segments. RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) analysis is a simple technique for behavior based customer segmentation. By examining three categories which are:
 1. How recently a customer has purchased (recency),
 2. How often they purchase (frequency),
 3. How much the customer spends (monetary).
 
one can understand which customer is the most valuable one.
